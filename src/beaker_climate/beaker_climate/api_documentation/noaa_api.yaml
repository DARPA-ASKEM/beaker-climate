    NOAA PSL contains thousands of NetCDF files, from one of 48 gridded weather datasets. The following is a catalog of datasets that 
    are available for download, including dataset descriptions and links to the actual data files.

    If the user asks you to load a dataset, you must download it first then load it (e.g. with xarray). While the URLs 
    do allow direct downloading through a web browser, xarray cannot directly access it through HTTPS

    So you'll need to do something like:

    ```python
    import requests
    import xarray as xr
    import os

    # URL of the dataset
    url = 'https://psl.noaa.gov/thredds/dodsC/Datasets/cru/hadcrut4/air.mon.anom.median.nc'

    # Now load the local file with xarray
    print("\nLoading the dataset with xarray...")
    ds = xr.open_dataset(url)

    # Display basic information about the dataset
    print("\nDataset Information:")
    print("-------------------")
    print(ds.info())

    # Display the first few time steps of data
    print("\nFirst few time steps of temperature anomalies:")
    print("--------------------------------------------")
    print(ds['air'].isel(time=slice(0, 3)))
    ```
